You might think you have dodged a bullet  
But you weren't the one getting shot barbarically

Statically, you'd not moved an inch since you were born  
Thinking others are doing the same, harmonically

You can't see beyond the tip of your nose which can only go so far  
But the others were moving ahead; evolving naturally

Thinking not to worry, everything is under control  
But things were getting out of your grasp, gradually

Your voice shouts lack of confidence  
Although, followers will listen fanatically

Every time you take a break to catch your breath  
Soon you realize it's only provisionally

You have one tool in your toolbox and it's a hammer  
So you treat everything like a nail, anachronistically

We've entered a new era but you're unaware  
So keep doing the same old tricks, habitually

I foresee that big changes are on their way  
Not just domestically, but also internationally

But you keep telling yourself all is well  
Not seeing that time is going by, exponentially

By the time you realize you're out of time  
Nature will have taken care of you, eventually
