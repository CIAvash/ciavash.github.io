<time datetime=2021-03-16>Mar 16, 2021</time></p></header>Recently I forked the flycheck-raku (by @widefox) to the Raku GitHub organization. And did some improvements to it and published it on melpa, so others can easily install and update it.
For those who don't know, flycheck is a tool for syntax checking Gnu Emacs buffers.
You can install flycheck-raku using use-package:
(use-package flychek-raku :ensure t) New features Project detection
Previously if you used flycheck-raku on a project, it would show errors on use SomeModule;, even though the module was in the lib directory of the project.<footer><a href=https://www.ciavash.name/blog/2021/03/16/improved-raku-flycheck-melpa-emacs/>Read More»</a></footer></article><article class="article article-list-item"><header><h2 class=article-title><a href=https://www.ciavash.name/blog/2016/10/16/movieinfo-web-app-for-finding-movie-information-ratings/>MovieInfo - A web app for finding movie information and ratings</a></h2><p class=article-meta><span class=article-author>By CIAvash •</span>
<time datetime=2016-10-16>Oct 16, 2016</time></p></header>I wanted to create something that makes it easy for me to see movie ratings. I decided to create it as a SPA. In order to do so, I had to find a good framework. I looked at a few well known frameworks, but did not like any of them!
I was going to give up, but then I saw Elm.

<time datetime=2016-05-12>May 12, 2016</time></p></header>App::Football is a command line program I wrote in Raku. football lets you access information regarding football(soccer!) teams, leagues, tables, fixtures, scores and players.
It uses another module I wrote called WebService::FootballData which is a Raku interface for football-data.org API.
To install App::Football, you need to first install Raku and Zef, then run:
zef install App::Football The README file has some useful examples, but here are more examples and screenshots:<footer><a href=https://www.ciavash.name/blog/2016/05/12/get-soccer-information-in-your-terminal-with-football/>Read More»</a></footer></article><article class="article article-list-item"><header><h2 class=article-title><a href=https://www.ciavash.name/blog/2016/01/09/entering-raku-unicode-characters-in-emacs/>How to type Raku unicode characters in Emacs</a></h2><p class=article-meta><span class=article-author>By CIAvash •</span>
<time datetime=2016-01-09>Jan 9, 2016</time></p></header>Raku programming language uses some unicode characters as operators, quotation marks, etc. In this post I'm going to explain how to type those characters in Emacs using input methods.
First, you might want to see a list of those characters and their ASCII equivalents here. There is also a doc for entering unicode characters. You may specifically want to look at XCompose for a system-wide solution.
There are at least two input methods you can use to enter the unicode characters used in Raku.<footer><a href=https://www.ciavash.name/blog/2016/01/09/entering-raku-unicode-characters-in-emacs/>Read More»</a></footer></article><article class="article article-list-item"><header><h2 class=article-title><a href=https://www.ciavash.name/blog/2014/06/04/magrent-1-0-released/>Magrent 1.0 released [Firefox]</a></h2><p class=article-meta><span class=article-author>By CIAvash •</span>

2 years ago I started learning Perl, soon Perl became my favourite programming language. It was then that our professor gave us the scanner project for C language. He told us that we can use the programming language of our choice.<footer><a href=https://www.ciavash.name/blog/2013/07/02/simple-parser-for-c-language/>Read More»</a></footer></article><article class="article article-list-item"><header><h2 class=article-title><a href=https://www.ciavash.name/blog/2012/12/11/restoring-grub-with-arch-linux-live-cd/>Restoring GRUB with Arch linux live CD</a></h2><p class=article-meta><span class=article-author>By CIAvash •</span>
<time datetime=2012-12-11>Dec 11, 2012</time></p></header>I had Arch linux on my computer and needed Windows for gaming; Windows installs its own boot loader, so I had to re-install grub. The following is what I did to restore grub.
I suppose that you know what you're doing! For example you need to know in which partition linux is installed.
Boot Arch linux from live CD.
Create a directory for chroot environment:
mkdir /mnt/root Mount the root partition and other necessary device and file systems:<footer><a href=https://www.ciavash.name/blog/2012/12/11/restoring-grub-with-arch-linux-live-cd/>Read More»</a></footer></article><article class="article article-list-item"><header><h2 class=article-title><a href=https://www.ciavash.name/blog/2012/11/12/move-from-ubuntu-to-arch-linux/>My move from Ubuntu to Arch Linux</a></h2><p class=article-meta><span class=article-author>By CIAvash •</span>
<time datetime=2012-11-12>Nov 12, 2012</time></p></header>About a month ago I decided to try a new linux distribution. I was using Ubuntu and was even waiting for Ubuntu 12.10. I chose Arch Linux for testing, and Installed it on my netbook. I really liked the installation process! Then I chose Xfce as Desktop Environment. After a few days I decided to move from Ubuntu to Arch Linux.
When I read an article about a window manager, I was reminded of Tiling Window Managers so I decided to check window managers before moving.<footer><a href=https://www.ciavash.name/blog/2012/11/12/move-from-ubuntu-to-arch-linux/>Read More»</a></footer></article></main></div></body></html>
