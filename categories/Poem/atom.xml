But you weren't the one getting shot barbarically&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Statically, you'd not moved an inch since you were born&lt;br>
Thinking others are doing the same, harmonically&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can't see beyond the tip of your nose which can only go so far&lt;br>
But the others were moving ahead; evolving naturally&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thinking not to worry, everything is under control&lt;br>
But things were getting out of your grasp, gradually&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your voice shouts lack of confidence&lt;br>
Although, followers will listen fanatically&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every time you take a break to catch your breath&lt;br>
Soon you realize it's only provisionally&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You have one tool in your toolbox and it's a hammer&lt;br>
So you treat everything like a nail, anachronistically&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We've entered a new era but you're unaware&lt;br>
So keep doing the same old tricks, habitually&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I foresee that big changes are on their way&lt;br>
Not just domestically, but also internationally&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But you keep telling yourself all is well&lt;br>
Not seeing that time is going by, exponentially&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the time you realize you're out of time&lt;br>
Nature will have taken care of you, eventually&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
